  My Daily Affirmations

  This simple web application is a variation of the classic "Easy Button".
  When the main button is pressed it uses the browser's built‑in
  text‑to‑speech engine to recite a series of four affirmations. A
  persistent counter shows how many times the button has been pressed.

  The markup structure mirrors the original Easy Button project, but
  elements have been renamed to reflect the new purpose. All styling
  lives in an external CSS file and the interactive behaviour is
  implemented in script.js.

    The main button that triggers affirmation playback. The styling
    targets this element using its id.
  -->
  <button id="affirmationBtn">Affirm</button>
  <!--
    A small button for clearing the counter. Resets the press count
    and updates the display.
  -->
  <button id="resetBtn">Reset</button>

  <!--
    The audio element that contains your pre‑recorded affirmations. When
    the button is pressed the JavaScript will rewind this audio and
    play it from the beginning. Replace `affirmations.mp3` with the
    filename you upload to the repository.
  -->
  <audio id="affirmationAudio" src="affirmations.mp3"></audio>

  <!--
    All JavaScript lives in this external file. Keeping it at the end
    of the document ensures that the DOM is parsed before the script
    runs.

  <script src="script.js"></script>
